Main difference from other tools is proper support for histograms and mechanism that will prevent us from [coordinated omission](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-pitfalls) error. When it comes to scripting and test suites, different scenarios - tool uses real programming language called *Lua*, so only programming skills are limiting us.
